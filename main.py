    Let's Embark on a Journey Through Poetry, Plants, and Time!

    The Book of Songs (《诗经》) is a foundational collection of poems intricately tied to social and historical development, serving as a prelude to Chinese national history. Created during the agricultural era, these poems capture:

    - Social Landscapes: Depictions of rural villages, marketplaces, and royal courts.
    - Historical Snapshots: Insights into ancestral lifestyles and living scenes.

    Through the Book of Songs, later generations can learn about the natural landscapes, flora and fauna, climate changes, land structures, production systems, ethnic distributions, transportation systems, and cultural customs from the early Western Zhou to mid-Spring and Autumn periods. The poems, carefully compiled, serve as vital historical documents for in-depth research into this era.

    In the Book of Songs, plants take center stage, weaving through nearly half of its 305 poems. With 386 plant-related references and 130 unique species, these verses reveal how deeply nature shaped ancient Chinese culture.

    💭 Worry

    🤔 Contemplation

    😢 Sadness

    😨 Fear

The results show that of the 36 occurrences of ‘桑’, 18 are in ‘spring’, 3 are in ‘autumn’, and 2 include the flow of the three seasons of ‘spring, summer, and autumn’, while the remaining 13 do not clearly reflect seasonal characteristics. From this we can see that in terms of seasons, ‘mulberry’ is more often associated with spring, followed by autumn, which may be related to the themes expressed in these verses, the two most prominent of which are agriculture and love, which are also two important themes of the Book of Songs.<br>In addition to this, related to time are the date and hour. Among these 36 occurrences, only one poem, ‘國風·豳風·七月’, mentions a specific month, from July to September, reflecting a detailed record of the months of agricultural activities in ancient societies. As for the hour, none of the verses explicitly mentions the hour, probably because these verses focus more on describing agricultural activities or emotional expressions than on specific points in time. It can be seen that compared to the relationship between ‘mulberry’ and the season, other time factors can hardly be taken into consideration.",
            "As far as farming is concerned, the two seasons of spring and autumn are crucial, one for sowing and the other for harvesting. Most of the poems related to ‘桑’ focus on spring, which is consistent with the fact that spring was the beginning of agricultural activities in ancient agricultural societies. Mulberry trees, as an important cash crop, and their young leaves were food for silkworms, so there were frequent activities of mulberry harvesting in spring. In addition, agricultural activities would also reflect seasonal changes. For example, the poem ‘國風·豳風·七月’ covers agricultural activities in all seasons of the year, from sowing in the spring to growing in the summer to harvesting in the autumn and preparing for the winter, which reflects the ancient agricultural society's reliance on and adaptation to seasonal changes. In the spring, the poem mentions ‘春日載陽’, indicating the arrival of spring, when agricultural activities, such as mulberry picking, begin. In the summer, the poem ‘七月流火’ implies the heat of summer, and ‘八月萑葦’ indicates the summer reeds. In autumn, the poem ‘八月其獲’ suggests that autumn is the season of harvesting. In winter, the poem ‘二之日鑿冰衝衝’ indicates that ice is chiselled in winter and used for preserving food.",
            "In the case of love, it is also tied to the seasons. In spring, there is an activity closely related to ‘桑’, namely ‘采桑 (picking mulberry)’. In the time of the Book of Songs, ‘采桑’ did not only represent agricultural activities, but was also a place for the expression of emotions and love between a man and a woman, as the activity of picking mulberry created an opportunity for young men and women to meet and get to know each other. The fact that most of these poems focus on spring reflects the importance of the mulberry tree in the economy and culture of ancient societies. The mulberry tree was not only a cash crop, but also a carrier of emotional and political allegories, such as a place for love between men and women and a praise for hard work."

The results show that of the 16 occurrences of ‘葛’, 5 are in ‘spring’, 4 in ‘autumn’, 3 in ‘winter’, 1 in ‘summer’, and the remaining 3 do not clearly reflect the seasonal characteristics. Thus, in terms of seasons, ‘葛’ is more often associated with spring, followed by autumn and winter, and also with summer. This has something to do with the characteristics of ‘葛’ itself. In Shuowen Jiezi (說文解字), ‘葛’ means ‘grass’, which can grow all year round as long as the environment allows. At the same time, the fibres of ‘葛’ can be woven into cloth, which is closely related to clothes. Therefore, words related to wearing clothes appear several times in the poem, such as ‘葛屢 (grass shoes)’ three times, i.e., ‘葛屨五兩，冠緌雙止’ (國風·齊風·南山) , ‘糾糾葛屨，可以履霜’ (小雅·小旻之什·大東).<br>Specifically, spring is the most frequently mentioned season in these poems, with a total of five poems related to spring. Most of these poems depict the growth and gathering of kudzu, such as the description of the luxuriant growth of kudzu in the valley in ‘國風·周南·葛覃’ and the expression of longing for the kudzu gatherers in ‘國風·鄭風·采葛’. There are three poems related to autumn, such as ‘國風·邶風·旄丘’ and ‘國風·王風·葛藟’, in which most of the verses express thoughts of distant relatives and feelings about fate. Three poems are related to winter, such as ‘國風·齊風·南山’ and ‘小雅·小旻之什·大東’. The image of kudzu in these verses is mostly associated with cold frosts, symbolising resilience and vitality. One poem is associated with summer, namely ‘國風·魏風·葛屨’, which describes the use of kudzu shoes to tread on frost, reflecting the use of kudzu products in summer.\nApart from this, there is no explicit reference to a specific month in the verses, so the distribution of months cannot be analysed in detail. The verses also do not mention the specific hour, so the distribution of the hour cannot be analysed. However, from the content of the verses, most of them are related to daily work and life, which may coincide with the farming life of working at sunrise and resting at sunset.''',
            '''‘葛’ is not only a plant in nature in these verses, but also carries a rich symbolic meaning. It is not only a symbol of life force, but also a carrier of thoughts and emotions. The growth, collection and use of kudzu in the verses are closely related to people's daily life, reflecting the ancient people's lifestyle of living in harmony with nature. Whether it is the longing for loved ones, the feeling of fate or the desire for a better life, kudzu grass has become an important medium for the poet to express his emotions. To sum up, these verses not only depict the growth of kudzu grass in different seasons, but also reflect the ancient people's delicate observation and deep perception of natural landscape, as well as the important position of kudzu grass in ancient social life.''',
